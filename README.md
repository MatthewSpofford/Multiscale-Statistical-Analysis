# Multiscale-Statistical-Analysis
## About
This is a standalone multiscale analysis software developed by [Nathaniel Rutkowski](https://github.com/nrutkowski1).
It uses length-scale, area-scale, or area-complexity data exported from MountainsMap®, developed by [Digital Surf](https://www.digitalsurf.com/).
The application can then be used to run multiscale regression or discrimination on the exported surface data using F-tests, T-Tests, or ANOVA analysis.
## Documentation
More information on how to use the application can be found [here](https://github.com/MatthewSpofford/Multiscale-Statistical-Analysis/blob/master/Multiscale%20Statistical%20Analysis%20Manual.pdf).
## Similar Projects
In order to integrate directly with the MountainsMap® software, a similar addon application is being worked on. It can be found [here](https://github.com/MatthewSpofford/Mountains-Statistical-Addons).
